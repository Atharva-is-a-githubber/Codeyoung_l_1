    <h1> Never gonna give you up! </h1>
    <p>
        Old internet jokes aside, it is neat to see the real world location where the classic Rick Astley video for his 1987 hit "Never Gonna Give You Up" was shot.
        For years we've all been staring unwittingly at those brick arches. 
        Now we know they're at 150 Freston Road in London.
        That's the curious magic of Google Maps.
        The Google Earth and Street View lets you, in an instant, drop in on any place in the world.
        Unsuspecting, it's all there, frozen in time.
        It's a feat of ubiquity from the tech giant that we can now get rickrolled by a map.
